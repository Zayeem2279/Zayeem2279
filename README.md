## 🙋‍♂️ About Me
I am a First-Year Computer Science student currently studying at University of south wales. As an international student, I view my degree as a global adventure—combining my drive to solve technical problems with my passion for exploring new environments.

My background in violin has taught me that great code, like music, requires both creativity and discipline. I am currently building my technical foundation in software development, computer systems, and information security, and I am excited to apply these skills to real-world projects.
## 🔭 What I Am Doing
I am currently a first-year student focusing on the fundamentals of Computer Science. My current coursework includes:

* **Programming (CS1D462):** Building core coding skills and logic.
* **Computer Systems Concepts (CS1S465):** Understanding how hardware and software interact.
* **Information Security (CS1S463):** Exploring data management, assurance, and security principles.
* **Mathematical Tools (MS1S460):** Applying logic and mathematics to computational problems.
* **Professionalism & Problem Solving (CS1S470):** Developing employability and enterprise skills.## 🛠 Skills
Here are the languages and tools I am currently using:

| Category | Technologies |
|Str|Str|
| **Languages** | Python, Java, HTML/CSS |
| **Tools** | Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub |
| **Soft Skills** | Teamwork, Problem Solving, Communication |

## 🎸 Hobbies
When I'm not coding, I love to balance my technical work with creative pursuits:
* **Gaming:** I enjoy immersing myself in story-driven RPGs, particularly those with complex narratives and world-building.
* **Violin:** I spend my free time practicing the violin and exploring different musical compositions.
* **Exploration:** As an international student, I love making the most of my time here by traveling and discovering the scenic wonders and hidden gems across the UK.
